    Utility functions for database institution handling.
    
    This module should implement Tenant_id in every route but
    I coundn't set it up in a way that it works with the async 
    session and the way I structured the code.

    So this function stays here for now, but it's not being used.
    The idea is to set the current institution in the database 
    session when should be possible
